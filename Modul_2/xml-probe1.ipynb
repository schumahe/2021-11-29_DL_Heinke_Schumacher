      "        \"abstract\": \"\\\"In this volume, Gareth Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly-used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself \\u00e4 composer seduced into mathematics,\\\" Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at http://www.musimathics.com Publisher description of vol. 1. Volume 2 of Musimathics continues the story of music engineering begun in volume 1, focusing on the digital and computational domain. Loy goes deeper into the mathematics of music and sound, beginning with digital audio, sampling, and binary numbers, as well as complex numbers and how they simplify representation of musical signals. Chapters cover the Fourier transform, convolution, filtering, resonance, the wave equation, acoustical systems, sound synthesis, the short-time Fourier transform, and the wavelet transform. These subjects provide the theoretical underpinnings of today's music technology. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio Publisher description.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"Many people intuitively sense that there is a connection between mathematics and music. If nothing else, both involve counting. There is, of course, much more to the association. David Wright's book is an investigation of the interrelationships between mathematics and music, reviewing the needed background concepts in each subject as they are encountered. Along the way, readers will augment their understanding of both mathematics and music. The text explores the common foundations of the two subjects, which are developed side by side. Musical and mathematical notions are brought together, such as scales and modular arithmetic, intervals and logarithms, tone and trigonometry, and timbre and harmonic analysis. When possible, discussions of musical and mathematical notions are directly interwoven. Occasionally the discourse dwells for a while on one subject and not the other, but eventually the connection is established, making this an integrative treatment of the two subjects. The book is a text for a freshman level college course suitable for musically inclined or mathematically inclined students, with the intent of breaking down any apprehension that either group might have for the other subject. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The mathematical prerequisites are a high-school level familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, functions, and graphs. Musically, the student should have had some exposure to musical staffs, standard clefs, and key signatures, though all of these are explained in the text Publisher description.\",\n",

The author, one of the 20th century's most prominent figures in music theory, pushes the boundaries of the study of pitch-structure beyond its conception as a static system for classifying and inter-relating chords and sets. Known by most music theorists as &#8220;GMIT&#8221;, the book is by far the most significant contribution to the field of systematic music theory in the last half-century, generating the framework for the &#8220;transformational theory&#8221; movement. Appearing almost twenty years after GMIT's initial publication, this Oxford University Press edition features a previously unpublished preface by the author, as well as a foreword by Edward Gollin contextualizing the work's significance for the current field of music theory.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"This book is recognized as the seminal work paving the way for current studies in mathematical and systematic approaches to music analysis. The author, one of the 20th century's most prominent figures in music theory, pushes the boundaries of the study of pitch-structure beyond its conception as a static system for classifying and inter-relating chords and sets. Known by most music theorists as &#8220;GMIT&#8221;, the book is by far the most significant contribution to the field of systematic music theory in the last half-century, generating the framework for the &#8220;transformational theory&#8221; movement. Appearing almost twenty years after GMIT's initial publication, this Oxford University Press edition features a previously unpublished preface by the author, as well as a foreword by Edward Gollin contextualizing the work's significance for the current field of music theory.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"The Topos of Music is the upgraded and vastly deepened English extension of the seminal German Geometrie der Tone. It reflects the dramatic progress of mathematical music theory and its operationalization by information technology since the publication of Geometrie der Tone in 1990. The conceptual basis has been vastly generalized to topos-theoretic foundations, including a corresponding thoroughly geometric musical logic. The theoretical models and results now include topologies for rhythm, melody, and harmony, as well as a classification theory of musical objects that comprises the topos-theoretic concept framework. Classification also implies techniques of algebraic moduli theory. The classical models of modulation and counterpoint have been extended to exotic scales and counterpoint interval dichotomies. The probably most exciting new field of research deals with musical performance and its implementation on advanced object-oriented software environments. This subject not only uses extensively the existing mathematical music theory, it also opens the language to differential equations and tools of differential geometry, such as Lie derivatives. Mathematical performance theory is the key to inverse performance theory, an advanced new research field which deals with the calculation of varieties of parameters which give rise to a determined performance. This field uses techniques of algebraic geometry and statistics, approaches which have already produced significant results in the understanding of highest-ranked human performances. The book's formal language and models are currently being used by leading researchers in Europe and Northern America and have become a foundation of music software design. This is also testified by the book's nineteen collaborators and the included CD-ROM containing software and music examples.\",\n",

This book represents the culmination of such shared processes. Each of these essays, written by leading writers on popular music, is analytical in some sense, but none of them treats analysis as an end in itself. The books presents a wide range of genres (rock, dance, TV soundtracks, country, pop, soul, easy listening, Turkish Arabesk) and deals with issues as broad as methodology, modernism, postmodernism, Marxism and communication. It aims to encourage listeners to think more seriously about the \\u2018social\\u2019 consequences of the music they spend time with and is the first collection of such essays to incorporate contextualisation in this way\",\n",

A liga\\u00e7\\u00e3o da m\\u00fasica com a ci\\u00eancia teve grande import\\u00e2ncia no per\\u00edodo cl\\u00e1ssicono s\\u00e9c.VI a.C. por Pit\\u00e1goras, onde houve a descoberta das raz\\u00f5es matem\\u00e1ticas por tr\\u00e1sdos sons depois de observado o comprimento dos martelos dos ferreiros.A autoria de Pit\\u00e1goras em sua obra \\u00e9 dado a descoberta do intervalo de umaoitava como sendo referente a uma rela\\u00e7\\u00e3o de freq\\u00fc\\u00eancia (altura: grave e agudo). Osseguidores de Pit\\u00e1goras aplicaram essas raz\\u00f5es ao comprimento de um instrumento chamado monoc\\u00f3rdio. Pit\\u00e1goras buscava rela\\u00e7\\u00f5es de comprimentos/raz\\u00f5es de n\\u00fameros inteiros que produzissem determinados intervalos sonoros e, portanto, foram capazes de determinar matematicamente a entona\\u00e7\\u00e3o (bom tom) de todo sistema musical. (...)A m\\u00fasica tornou-se uma extens\\u00e3o da matem\\u00e1tica, bem como a arte. A matem\\u00e1tica e as descobertas musicais de Pit\\u00e1goras foram, desta forma, de grande influ\\u00eancia no desenvolvimento da m\\u00fasica atrav\\u00e9s da idade m\\u00e9dia na Europa. Essa monografia despertar\\u00e1 o interesse de muitos leitores para a obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o deum melhor conhecimento e enriquecimento na aprendizagem, quando raramentepensamos na an\\u00e1lise cient\\u00edfica com a arte musical.Conhecer essas influ\\u00eancias matem\\u00e1ticas \\u00e9, antes de tudo, conhecer a ess\\u00eancia da pr\\u00f3pria m\\u00fasica.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"Youth music is the most creative and contested location on the cultural landscape.  It is a vehicle for generational moods and aspirations, a public refuge for fantasies outlawed in daily life, a testing ground for technical ingenuity, an enormously profitable commercial channel for mainstream narratives of thought and behavior, and one of the corporate state's main theatres for national moral panic.  Today's sounds, and the debates about their various forms, are inseparable from the social conditions of the last two decades:  class polarization, racial marginalization, and economic violence enacted to a degree that has left youth, as a whole, with drastically reduced opportunities in life.  Youth culture is still responding to these uneven developments with a passion that has been romanticized by some critics as a significant form of resistance, and denigrated by others as an avoidance of direct and political protest.<br><br><b></b><b><i>Microphone Fiends</i></b><b></b>, a collection of original essays and interviews, brings together some of the best known scholars, critics, journalists and performers to focus on the contemporary scene.  It includes theoretical discussions of musical history along with social commentaries about genres like disco, metal and rap music, and case histories of specific movements like the Riot Grrls, funk clubbing in Rio de Janeiro, and the British rave scene.  The contents of the volume engage with the broad tradition of cultural studies and sociology of youth music and culture, but they are also designed to address audiences reached by mainstream music journalism and fans of any musical taste.\",\n",

Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly-used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself ä composer seduced into mathematics,\" Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at http://www.musimathics.com Publisher description of vol. 1. Volume 2 of Musimathics continues the story of music engineering begun in volume 1, focusing on the digital and computational domain. Loy goes deeper into the mathematics of music and sound, beginning with digital audio, sampling, and binary numbers, as well as complex numbers and how they simplify representation of musical signals.

If nothing else, both involve counting. There is, of course, much more to the association. David Wright's book is an investigation of the interrelationships between mathematics and music, reviewing the needed background concepts in each subject as they are encountered. Along the way, readers will augment their understanding of both mathematics and music. The text explores the common foundations of the two subjects, which are developed side by side. Musical and mathematical notions are brought together, such as scales and modular arithmetic, intervals and logarithms, tone and trigonometry, and timbre and harmonic analysis. When possible, discussions of musical and mathematical notions are directly interwoven. Occasionally the discourse dwells for a while on one subject and not the other, but eventually the connection is established, making this an integrative treatment of the two subjects. The book is a text for a freshman level college course suitable for musically inclined or mathematically inclined students, with the intent of breaking down any apprehension that either group might have for the other subject. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The mathematical prerequisites are a high-school level familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, functions, and graphs. Musically, the student should have had some exposure to musical staffs, standard clefs, and key signatures, though all of these are explained in the text Publisher description.\", 'isbn': '9780821848739 0821848739'}, {'type': 'Publication', 'id': 'https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2476dc161a46edb04f76d3a7310b3c111/bliek', 'tags': ['imported'], 'description': '', 'label': 'Perspectives on American music 1900-1950', 'date': '2010-01-27 22:12:50', 'changeDate': '2010-01-27 22:12:56', 'count': 1, 'pub-type': 'book', 'publisher': 'General Music Publishing Co.', 'year': '2000', 'url': '', 'abstract': 'Examines musical life in the United States during the first half of the 20th-c., with an emphasis on the rise and triumph of popular forms such as jazz, swing, and blues, and the importance of Ives, Cage, and Copland, among others, to art music.

Appearing almost twenty years after GMIT's initial publication, this Oxford University Press edition features a previously unpublished preface by the author, as well as a foreword by Edward Gollin contextualizing the work's significance for the current field of music theory.\", 'isbn': '9780199717842 0199717842'}, {'type': 'Publication', 'id': 'https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2de14464025a43358df0c2321ff2eacb5/sapo', 'tags': [], 'description': '', 'label': 'A Roadmap for Sound and Music Computing', 'date': '2019-06-27 20:25:08', 'changeDate': '2019-06-27 20:25:08', 'count': 1, 'pub-type': 'book', 'publisher': 'The S2S2 Consortium', 'year': '2007', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en{\\\\&}btnG=Search{\\\\&}q=intitle:A+Roadmap+for+Sound+and+Music+Computing{\\\\#}0', 'author': ['Xavier Serra', 'Marc Leman', 'Gerhard Widmer'], 'authors': [{'first': 'Xavier', 'last': 'Serra'}, {'first': 'Marc', 'last': 'Leman'}, {'first': 'Gerhard', 'last': 'Widmer'}], 'abstract': 'Music is an important aspect of all human cultures.

It reflects the dramatic progress of mathematical music theory and its operationalization by information technology since the publication of Geometrie der Tone in 1990. The conceptual basis has been vastly generalized to topos-theoretic foundations, including a corresponding thoroughly geometric musical logic. The theoretical models and results now include topologies for rhythm, melody, and harmony, as well as a classification theory of musical objects that comprises the topos-theoretic concept framework. Classification also implies techniques of algebraic moduli theory. The classical models of modulation and counterpoint have been extended to exotic scales and counterpoint interval dichotomies. The probably most exciting new field of research deals with musical performance and its implementation on advanced object-oriented software environments. This subject not only uses extensively the existing mathematical music theory, it also opens the language to differential equations and tools of differential geometry, such as Lie derivatives. Mathematical performance theory is the key to inverse performance theory, an advanced new research field which deals with the calculation of varieties of parameters which give rise to a determined performance. This field uses techniques of algebraic geometry and statistics, approaches which have already produced significant results in the understanding of highest-ranked human performances. The book's formal language and models are currently being used by leading researchers in Europe and Northern America and have become a foundation of music software design. This is also testified by the book's nineteen collaborators and the included CD-ROM containing software and music examples.\"}, {'type': 'Publication', 'id': 'https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2e3bec615d5e50884343cbc5b59f28007/baltazhar', 'tags': ['music', 'sociology', 'popular', 'musicology'], 'description': '', 'label': 'Analyzing popular music', 'date': '2008-10-13 02:04:24', 'changeDate': '2008-10-13 02:04:24', 'count': 1, 'pub-type': 'book', 'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'year': '2003', 'url': 'http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521771207', 'abstract': 'How do we know music?

      "        \"abstract\": \"\\\"In this volume, Gareth Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly-used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself \\u00e4 composer seduced into mathematics,\\\" Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at http://www.musimathics.com Publisher description of vol. 1. Volume 2 of Musimathics continues the story of music engineering begun in volume 1, focusing on the digital and computational domain. Loy goes deeper into the mathematics of music and sound, beginning with digital audio, sampling, and binary numbers, as well as complex numbers and how they simplify representation of musical signals. Chapters cover the Fourier transform, convolution, filtering, resonance, the wave equation, acoustical systems, sound synthesis, the short-time Fourier transform, and the wavelet transform. These subjects provide the theoretical underpinnings of today's music technology. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio Publisher description.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"Many people intuitively sense that there is a connection between mathematics and music. If nothing else, both involve counting. There is, of course, much more to the association. David Wright's book is an investigation of the interrelationships between mathematics and music, reviewing the needed background concepts in each subject as they are encountered. Along the way, readers will augment their understanding of both mathematics and music. The text explores the common foundations of the two subjects, which are developed side by side. Musical and mathematical notions are brought together, such as scales and modular arithmetic, intervals and logarithms, tone and trigonometry, and timbre and harmonic analysis. When possible, discussions of musical and mathematical notions are directly interwoven. Occasionally the discourse dwells for a while on one subject and not the other, but eventually the connection is established, making this an integrative treatment of the two subjects. The book is a text for a freshman level college course suitable for musically inclined or mathematically inclined students, with the intent of breaking down any apprehension that either group might have for the other subject. Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The mathematical prerequisites are a high-school level familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, functions, and graphs. Musically, the student should have had some exposure to musical staffs, standard clefs, and key signatures, though all of these are explained in the text Publisher description.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"The Topos of Music is the upgraded and vastly deepened English extension of the seminal German Geometrie der Tone. It reflects the dramatic progress of mathematical music theory and its operationalization by information technology since the publication of Geometrie der Tone in 1990. The conceptual basis has been vastly generalized to topos-theoretic foundations, including a corresponding thoroughly geometric musical logic. The theoretical models and results now include topologies for rhythm, melody, and harmony, as well as a classification theory of musical objects that comprises the topos-theoretic concept framework. Classification also implies techniques of algebraic moduli theory. The classical models of modulation and counterpoint have been extended to exotic scales and counterpoint interval dichotomies. The probably most exciting new field of research deals with musical performance and its implementation on advanced object-oriented software environments. This subject not only uses extensively the existing mathematical music theory, it also opens the language to differential equations and tools of differential geometry, such as Lie derivatives. Mathematical performance theory is the key to inverse performance theory, an advanced new research field which deals with the calculation of varieties of parameters which give rise to a determined performance. This field uses techniques of algebraic geometry and statistics, approaches which have already produced significant results in the understanding of highest-ranked human performances. The book's formal language and models are currently being used by leading researchers in Europe and Northern America and have become a foundation of music software design. This is also testified by the book's nineteen collaborators and the included CD-ROM containing software and music examples.\"\n",

A liga\\u00e7\\u00e3o da m\\u00fasica com a ci\\u00eancia teve grande import\\u00e2ncia no per\\u00edodo cl\\u00e1ssicono s\\u00e9c.VI a.C. por Pit\\u00e1goras, onde houve a descoberta das raz\\u00f5es matem\\u00e1ticas por tr\\u00e1sdos sons depois de observado o comprimento dos martelos dos ferreiros.A autoria de Pit\\u00e1goras em sua obra \\u00e9 dado a descoberta do intervalo de umaoitava como sendo referente a uma rela\\u00e7\\u00e3o de freq\\u00fc\\u00eancia (altura: grave e agudo). Osseguidores de Pit\\u00e1goras aplicaram essas raz\\u00f5es ao comprimento de um instrumento chamado monoc\\u00f3rdio. Pit\\u00e1goras buscava rela\\u00e7\\u00f5es de comprimentos/raz\\u00f5es de n\\u00fameros inteiros que produzissem determinados intervalos sonoros e, portanto, foram capazes de determinar matematicamente a entona\\u00e7\\u00e3o (bom tom) de todo sistema musical. (...)A m\\u00fasica tornou-se uma extens\\u00e3o da matem\\u00e1tica, bem como a arte. A matem\\u00e1tica e as descobertas musicais de Pit\\u00e1goras foram, desta forma, de grande influ\\u00eancia no desenvolvimento da m\\u00fasica atrav\\u00e9s da idade m\\u00e9dia na Europa. Essa monografia despertar\\u00e1 o interesse de muitos leitores para a obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o deum melhor conhecimento e enriquecimento na aprendizagem, quando raramentepensamos na an\\u00e1lise cient\\u00edfica com a arte musical.Conhecer essas influ\\u00eancias matem\\u00e1ticas \\u00e9, antes de tudo, conhecer a ess\\u00eancia da pr\\u00f3pria m\\u00fasica.\",\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"Youth music is the most creative and contested location on the cultural landscape.  It is a vehicle for generational moods and aspirations, a public refuge for fantasies outlawed in daily life, a testing ground for technical ingenuity, an enormously profitable commercial channel for mainstream narratives of thought and behavior, and one of the corporate state's main theatres for national moral panic.  Today's sounds, and the debates about their various forms, are inseparable from the social conditions of the last two decades:  class polarization, racial marginalization, and economic violence enacted to a degree that has left youth, as a whole, with drastically reduced opportunities in life.  Youth culture is still responding to these uneven developments with a passion that has been romanticized by some critics as a significant form of resistance, and denigrated by others as an avoidance of direct and political protest.<br><br><b></b><b><i>Microphone Fiends</i></b><b></b>, a collection of original essays and interviews, brings together some of the best known scholars, critics, journalists and performers to focus on the contemporary scene.  It includes theoretical discussions of musical history along with social commentaries about genres like disco, metal and rap music, and case histories of specific movements like the Riot Grrls, funk clubbing in Rio de Janeiro, and the British rave scene.  The contents of the volume engage with the broad tradition of cultural studies and sociology of youth music and culture, but they are also designed to address audiences reached by mainstream music journalism and fans of any musical taste.\",\n",
